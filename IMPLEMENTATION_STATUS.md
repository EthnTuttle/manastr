# Stateless Manastr Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed
1. **Architectural Analysis**: Identified the core issue - shared local state between players
2. **Design Documentation**: Created comprehensive architecture plan for Nostr + Cashu stateless client  
3. **Data Structure Design**: Created `ChallengeView` and `MatchView` for stateless event-driven UI
4. **Initial Refactoring**: Started removing shared state from Manastr struct

## ðŸš§ Current State 
- Partially refactored Manastr struct to be stateless
- Has compilation errors due to incomplete migration from old PlayerGameData
- Need to complete the refactoring to get a working baseline

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Steps (to fix the shared state issue)

### Quick Fix Option: Minimal Working Version
Instead of completing the full stateless refactor (which is complex), create a minimal fix:

1. **Keep current architecture but separate by account**
   - Make `global_matches` keyed by account: `account_matches: HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Match>>`
   - Each account gets its own isolated match pool
   - This fixes the immediate "both players see same state" problem

2. **Add query-on-render for challenges**  
   - Query Nostr for available challenges each time matchmaking renders
   - Don't store challenges locally - query fresh each time

3. **Test with two accounts**
   - Verify Player A's actions don't immediately appear to Player B
   - Verify each account has independent match state

### Full Stateless Version (Long-term)
Continue with the comprehensive stateless architecture once the immediate issue is resolved.

## ðŸ”§ Recommended Action

**Option A (Quick Fix)**: Revert some changes and implement account-separated state
- Faster to implement
- Fixes the immediate shared state problem  
- Maintains current functionality
- Can migrate to full stateless later

**Option B (Complete Stateless)**: Finish the full refactoring
- More future-proof
- Requires significant implementation work
- May break existing functionality temporarily
- True solution to the architecture problem

## Decision Point
Which approach would you prefer?
1. Quick fix to resolve immediate shared state issue, then iterate
2. Complete the full stateless implementation

The integration tests provide a good reference for how the stateless version should work - each "player" queries Nostr independently and reconstructs state from events.
