# CDK-mintd Configuration for Deterministic Integration Testing
# ==========================================================
# 
# This configuration provides reproducible, deterministic Cashu token generation
# for integration testing with the Manastr gaming system. Key features:
#
# üîë DETERMINISTIC KEYS: Fixed mnemonic ensures same C values across test runs
# üéÆ GAMING OPTIMIZED: Configured for army generation via token C values
# ‚ö° FAST TESTING: Minimal delays and fees for rapid integration test cycles
# üîÑ DUAL CURRENCY: Supports both "mana" (gameplay) and "loot" (rewards) tokens

# Gaming Token Authorization System
# NOTE: Full implementation requires extending CDK with unit-specific authorization
# Current approach: Document intended authorization model for future implementation
# 
# INTENDED AUTHORIZATION RULES:
# 1. MANA TOKENS:
#    - ‚úÖ Anyone can mint mana (pay-to-mint model)
#    - ‚ùå Only Game Engine can melt mana (burn after matches)
#    - ‚ùå Mana cannot be swapped between users (gaming integrity)
# 
# 2. LOOT TOKENS:
#    - ‚ùå Only Game Engine can mint loot (95% player rewards)
#    - ‚úÖ Loot can be freely transferred/swapped (player ownership)
#
# TODO: Implement CDK extension for unit-specific authorization:
# - Extend authorization middleware to check currency unit + caller identity
# - Add Game Engine Nostr signature verification
# - Implement unit-specific endpoint protection
