# Player-Driven Integration Tests

This directory contains the refactored integration tests for the player-driven gaming architecture. The tests have been organized into a clean, modular structure for better maintainability and readability.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Organization**
- **Core**: Contains the main test suite and individual test modules
- **Players**: Player management and test player creation
- **Matches**: All match-related data structures and types
- **Validation**: Validation logic and verification functions
- **Utils**: Common utility functions used across tests

### 2. **Clean Separation of Concerns**
- Each module has a specific responsibility
- Test logic is separated from data structures
- Utility functions are centralized and reusable

### 3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Each function has clear docstring comments explaining its purpose
- Removed excessive documentation while keeping essential information
- Focused on describing what each function does rather than why

### 4. **Improved Maintainability**
- Easier to locate specific functionality
- Simpler to add new test scenarios
- Better code organization for future development

## Test Scenarios

The integration tests cover the following scenarios:

1. **Happy Path**: Complete player-driven match lifecycle
2. **Anti-Cheat**: Commitment verification and cheating detection
3. **Concurrent Matches**: Multiple simultaneous matches
4. **Edge Cases**: Malformed events and malicious inputs
5. **Stress Testing**: High-volume match processing

## Running the Tests

```bash
cd daemons/integration_tests
cargo run --bin main
```

## Key Functions

### Core Test Suite
- `PlayerDrivenTestSuite::new()`: Creates a new test suite instance
- `run_comprehensive_tests()`: Executes all test scenarios
- `TestSuiteCore`: Shared core functionality used by all test modules

### Player Management
- `TestPlayer`: Represents a test player with all components
- Player creation includes Nostr keys, gaming wallet, and session data

### Match Operations
- `create_and_publish_match_challenge()`: Creates and publishes match challenges
- `create_and_publish_match_acceptance()`: Handles match acceptance
- `publish_token_reveal()`: Publishes token revelations for army verification
- `simulate_combat_rounds()`: Simulates combat with commitment/reveal pattern

### Validation
- `verify_loot_distribution()`: Verifies game engine loot distribution
- `ValidationSummary`: Tracks validation results and integrity scores

## Architecture Benefits

This refactored structure provides:

1. **Better Code Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
2. **Easier Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
3. **Improved Readability**: Clear separation makes the code easier to understand
4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes can be made to specific modules without affecting others
5. **Scalability**: New test scenarios can be added easily to the appropriate modules

## Future Enhancements

The modular structure makes it easy to add:

- New test scenarios in the `core/` directory
- Additional player types in the `players/` module
- New match event types in the `matches/` module
- Enhanced validation logic in the `validation/` module
- Additional utility functions in the `utils/` module
