  ‚éø Plan: Web Interface Recreating Integration Test Flow

    The web interface will recreate the exact same real data flow as just integration but through the web UI, with live 
    monitoring of all entities.

    üéØ Core Concept

    - Keep just integration unchanged - it remains the reference implementation
    - Web interface recreates the same flow using the same real services, real players, real data
    - Live dashboard shows all entities (services + players) with real-time activity
    - Interactive controls to execute the same 7-phase match flow through the web

    üìã Implementation Plan

    1. Dashboard Layout with Entity Boxes

    Service Entity Boxes (Top Row):
    - üì° Nostr Relay: Live logs, event counts, WebSocket activity from real relay
    - üí∞ Cashu Mint: Health status, token operations, mint info from real mint  
    - üéÆ Game Engine Bot: State machine status, match validations, live activity

    Player Entity Boxes (Middle Row):
    - üèõÔ∏è Alexi: Real wallet balance, npub, army data, events published (deterministic seed: "Alexi")
    - üèõÔ∏è Boberto: Real wallet balance, npub, army data, events published (deterministic seed: "Boberto")

    Live Activity Feed (Bottom):
    - Real-time stream of all Nostr events (kinds 31000-31006)
    - Match phase progression with visual indicators
    - Service logs and activity (if accessible)

    2. Recreate Integration Test Player Creation

    // Same logic as integration test but in web client
    async createRealPlayer(name, seed) {
      // Use same deterministic key generation as integration test
      const keys = createDeterministicKeys(seed);
      
      // Connect to real mint and create real gaming wallet
      const wallet = new GamingWallet(realMintUrl);
      const tokens = await wallet.mintGamingTokens(100, "mana");
      
      // Connect to real Nostr relay
      const nostrClient = new NDK({ explicitRelayUrls: [realRelayUrl], signer });
      
      return { name, keys, wallet, nostrClient, tokens };
    }

    3. Interactive Match Flow Recreation

    Recreate the exact 7-phase flow with buttons that execute real operations:

    Phase 1: Create Alexi & Boberto (real players, real wallets, real tokens)
    Phase 2: Alexi creates match challenge (real Nostr event kind 31000)
    Phase 3: Boberto accepts challenge (real Nostr event kind 31001) 
    Phase 4: Both reveal tokens (real Nostr events kind 31002)
    Phase 5: Execute combat rounds (real move commits/reveals kinds 31003/31004)
    Phase 6: Submit results (real match result events kind 31005)
    Phase 7: Game engine validates & distributes loot (real kind 31006)

    4. Real Data Integration

    - Real deterministic keys: Use same seeds as integration test ("Alexi", "Boberto")
    - Real Cashu operations: Actual mint calls, real token generation, real C values
    - Real Nostr events: Publish actual events to real relay, same as integration test
    - Real game engine: Interact with real game engine bot, get real validations
    - Real armies: Generate from real Cashu token C values, same as integration test

    5. Live Monitoring & Streaming

    Each entity box shows real-time activity:
    - Service boxes: Live connection status, event processing, health checks
    - Player boxes: Real balance updates, actual event publishing, army changes
    - Activity feed: All real Nostr events, service logs, state changes

    üõ†Ô∏è Minimal Implementation Strategy

    Phase 1: Entity Dashboard Structure

    1. HTML/CSS layout for service and player entity boxes
    2. Real service connections to display live status
    3. Basic live activity feed for Nostr events

    Phase 2: Real Player Recreation

    1. Deterministic player creation using integration test logic
    2. Real gaming wallet integration with actual mint operations
    3. Real Nostr client setup with actual relay connections

    Phase 3: Interactive Match Flow

    1. 7-phase button controls that execute real operations
    2. Real event publishing to actual Nostr relay
    3. Real game engine interaction for validation and loot

    Phase 4: Live Monitoring Polish

    1. Real-time updates for all entity boxes
    2. Enhanced activity parsing for match progression
    3. Service log streaming (if possible)

    üéÆ Expected Result

    The web interface becomes a live interactive version of just integration:
    - Same real data flow as integration test but controllable through web UI
    - Live dashboard showing all entities and their real-time activity  
    - Interactive controls to execute the revolutionary gaming flow step-by-step
    - Real backend integration - everything uses actual services and real data

    Users can manually execute the same match flow that just integration runs automatically, while watching all the services
     and players in real-time through the entity monitoring boxes.

    üîß Technical Foundation

    - Reuse existing: NDK and Cashu-TS integrations already working
    - Same deterministic logic: Copy integration test's player creation exactly
    - Real service calls: All operations use actual mint, relay, game engine
    - Live event streaming: Already have Nostr event subscription working
