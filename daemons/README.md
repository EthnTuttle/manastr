## 🎮 Revolutionary Services

### 1. Pure Validator Game Engine (`game-engine-bot/`) - Port 4444
- **Revolutionary Role**: ONLY validates player-submitted outcomes - NEVER coordinates
- **Anti-Cheat**: Cryptographic commitment/reveal verification
- **Features**: Real-time cheating detection, automatic match invalidation
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` - Health check
  - `GET /status` - Validation statistics
- **Architecture**: Pure validation with zero coordination authority

### 2. Nostr Relay (`nostr-relay/`) - Port 7777
- **Purpose**: Decentralized event coordination backbone
- **Backend**: nostr-rs-relay (Rust-based, cross-platform)
- **Platform Support**: ✅ macOS, ✅ Linux, ✅ Windows
- **Event Types**: 7 player-driven event kinds (31000-31006)

### 3. Pure CDK Mint (`cashu-mint/`) - Port 3333 ⏳
- **Purpose**: Standard Cashu protocol implementation with dual currencies
- **Currencies**: "mana" (mint-only), "loot" (meltable rewards)
- **Architecture**: NO game logic - pure protocol compliance
- **Status**: Ready for implementation

### 4. Shared Game Logic (`shared-game-logic/`)
- **Purpose**: Deterministic combat logic for client-server synchronization
- **Targets**: Native Rust + WASM for perfect synchronization
- **Features**: Cryptographic commitment functions, deterministic combat

## 🎯 Revolutionary Player-Driven Testing

### Quick Start - Test Zero-Coordination Architecture
```bash
# Test the revolutionary architecture (ONLY current test)
./run-player-driven-tests.sh
```

   - Automatic loot distribution validation

2. **🔒 Anti-Cheat Commitment Verification**
   - Detects and invalidates cheating attempts
   - Tests cryptographic commitment integrity
   - Validates real-time match invalidation

3. **⚡ Concurrent Player-Driven Matches**
   - Multiple matches running simultaneously
   - Tests pure validation architecture scalability
   - No coordination conflicts between matches

4. **🛡️ Edge Cases and Malicious Events**
   - Malformed event handling

   - Timing attack resistance

5. **🚀 High-Volume Match Processing**
   - Stress testing with 20+ concurrent matches
   - Performance validation under load
   - Revolutionary architecture scalability proof

### 🏆 Revolutionary Architecture Breakthrough

**What makes this revolutionary?**

❌ **Traditional Multiplayer Games:**
- Require trusted central servers
- Server controls match creation and progression  
- Can manipulate outcomes or cheat players
- Single points of failure and censorship

✅ **Zero-Coordination Architecture:**
- **Players control everything** via cryptographically-secured Nostr events
- **Game engine cannot cheat** - only validates player-submitted outcomes
- **Perfect decentralization** - no central authority required
- **Cryptographically secure** - commitment/reveal prevents all cheating

## 🔑 Nostr-First Architecture

All components use **Nostr types for consistency**:

```rust
// ✅ CORRECT: Use Nostr types everywhere
use nostr::{Keys, PublicKey, SecretKey, EventId};
let player_keys = Keys::from_hex_str("deterministic_test_key")?;
let match_event_id = EventId::from_hex("match_event_hex")?;

// ❌ WRONG: Custom string/UUID types (legacy approach)
let player_id = "custom_player_123";
let match_id = Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
```
