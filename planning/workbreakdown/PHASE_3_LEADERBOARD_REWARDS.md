# Phase 3: Leaderboard & Rewards Enhancement (2 weeks)

## Overview
Enhance leaderboard system with advanced features, reward mechanisms, and social elements for long-term player engagement.

## Work Packages

### WP3.1: Advanced Leaderboard Features (5 days)
**Agent:** leaderboard-dev  
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 leaderboard service  
**Input:** `/implementation/leaderboard/`  
**Output:** Enhanced leaderboard with multi-timeframe and analytics

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Multi-timeframe rankings (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time)
- [ ] Player performance analytics and trend tracking
- [ ] Matchup history between specific players
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Leaderboard export and sharing features

**Agent Tasks:**
```
Week 1: Multi-timeframe system
1. Implement daily/weekly/monthly/all-time rankings
2. Build efficient time-window queries
3. Create ranking history and trend analysis
4. Implement performance metrics (win rate, average damage, etc.)
5. Build advanced filtering (by league, rating range, activity)
6. Create leaderboard caching and optimization
7. Add player head-to-head comparison features
8. Implement ranking prediction algorithms
```

**Multi-Timeframe Design:**
```rust
// src/timeframes.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum Timeframe {
    Daily(Date),
    Weekly(WeekOf),
    Monthly(YearMonth),
    AllTime,
    Custom { start: DateTime<Utc>, end: DateTime<Utc> },
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct TimeframedRanking {
    pub timeframe: Timeframe,
    pub rankings: Vec<PlayerRanking>,
    pub total_players: u32,
    pub generated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}

// Advanced analytics
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PlayerAnalytics {
    pub player_id: PlayerId,
    pub win_rate_trend: Vec<(Date, f64)>,
    pub rating_progression: Vec<(DateTime<Utc>, u32)>,
    pub favorite_leagues: Vec<(LeagueId, u32)>, // league, games played
    pub peak_rating: u32,
    pub longest_win_streak: u32,
}
```

**Automated Validation:**
```bash
# Multi-timeframe accuracy
python test_timeframe_rankings.py --all-periods
# Performance with large datasets
python benchmark_leaderboard_queries.py --players=50000
# Analytics calculations
python test_player_analytics.py --comprehensive

    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub bonus_loot: u64,
    pub requirements: AchievementRequirements,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum AchievementRequirements {
    WinStreak(u32),
    TotalWins(u32),
    RatingThreshold(u32),
    LeagueMastery(LeagueId, u32), // league, wins required
    PerfectSeason(u32), // no losses in timeframe
}

// Anti-manipulation detection
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ManipulationDetector {
    pub suspicious_patterns: Vec<SuspiciousPattern>,
    pub confidence_threshold: f64,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum SuspiciousPattern {
    RapidRatingGain(PlayerId, u32), // player, rating increase
    UnusualWinRate(PlayerId, f64),  // player, win rate
    CoordinatedMatches(Vec<PlayerId>), // potential collusion
}
```

**Automated Validation:**
```bash
# Reward calculation accuracy
