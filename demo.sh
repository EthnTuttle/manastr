echo "   • Test with: curl http://localhost:4444/status"
echo
echo "2. Start the Web Client:"
echo "   cd daemons/web-client && npm run dev"
echo "   • Client runs on http://localhost:5173"
echo "   • Features: Combat simulator, unit generation, league selection"
echo
echo "3. Test WASM Integration:"
echo "   • Generate units from token secrets (identical to server logic)"
echo "   • Run combat simulations (results match server authority)"
echo "   • Select different leagues (modifiers applied via WASM)"
echo
echo "4. Optional: Start supporting services:"
echo "   • Cashu Mint: cd daemons/cashu-mint && cargo run"
echo "   • Nostr Relay: cd daemons/nostr-relay && ./start.sh"
