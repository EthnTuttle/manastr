# 💰 Optimized Economic Model

## Revolutionary Player-Friendly Economics

The Mana Strategy Game implements the **most competitive gaming economy possible** while ensuring system sustainability. Our optimized economic model maximizes player value with transparent, mathematically verifiable rewards.

### 🎯 Core Principles

#### **95% Player Rewards**
- Winners receive **95% of total mana wagered** as loot tokens
- Maximum possible player value while maintaining system viability
- Transparent calculation: `total_wager * 95 / 100 = loot_tokens`

#### **5% System Fee**  
- Minimal operational cost for mint/game engine sustainability
- Covers infrastructure, anti-cheat validation, and loot distribution
- Lower than any traditional gaming platform

#### **Winner-Takes-All Model**
- Single winner receives 95% of **combined wagers** from both players
- Creates maximum incentive for competitive gameplay
- Rewards skill and strategy over participation

## Economic Flow

### Match Example: 50 + 50 = 100 Mana Total

```
Player 1 Wager: 50 mana
Player 2 Wager: 50 mana
Total Pool:     100 mana

Winner Receives: 95 loot tokens (95% of total)
System Fee:      5 mana tokens (5% of total)
```

### Economic Cycle

```

### Mathematical Validation

```rust
// Economic Model Implementation
pub fn calculate_loot_distribution(total_mana_wagered: u64) -> LootDistribution {
    let player_loot_amount = (total_mana_wagered * 95) / 100;
    let system_fee = total_mana_wagered - player_loot_amount;
    
    // Validation: Always equals 100%
    assert_eq!(player_loot_amount + system_fee, total_mana_wagered);
    
    LootDistribution {
        total_mana_wagered,
        player_loot_amount,  // 95%
        system_fee,          // 5%
        reward_percentage: 95,
        fee_percentage: 5,
    }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Code Integration

The economic model is implemented across multiple components:

#### **Gaming Wallet (`gaming_wallet.rs`)**
```rust
/// Simulate receiving loot tokens using optimized 95/5 split
pub async fn simulate_loot_reward(&mut self, total_mana_wagered: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let loot_amount = (total_mana_wagered * 95) / 100;
    let system_fee = total_mana_wagered - loot_amount;
    
    // Winner receives 95% as loot tokens
    self.mint_gaming_tokens(loot_amount, "loot").await?;
}
```

#### **Integration Tests (`player-driven-integration-test.rs`)**
```rust
/// Demonstrate optimized loot claiming with 95% efficiency
async fn demonstrate_loot_claiming(&self, winner: &TestPlayer, total_wager: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let expected_loot = (total_wager * 95) / 100;
    // Winner claims 95% of total wager as loot tokens
}
```

#### **Game Engine (`match_events.rs`)**
```rust
/// Calculate optimized loot amount for Nostr events
pub fn calculate_optimized_loot_amount(&self) -> u64 {
    let total_wager = self.total_mana_wagered();
    (total_wager * 95) / 100  // 95% to winner
}
```

### Nostr Event Integration

Loot distribution events (KIND 31006) include optimized amounts:

```json
{
  "kind": 31006,
  "tags": [
    ["winner", "npub1..."],
    ["loot_amount", "95"],  // 100 mana * 95% = 95 loot
    ["match_fee", "5"]      // 5% system fee
  ],
  "content": {
    "total_mana_wagered": 100,
    "player_loot_amount": 95,
    "system_fee": 5,
    "reward_percentage": 95
  }
}
```

## Competitive Analysis

### Traditional Gaming Platforms

## Economic Benefits

### For Players
- **Maximum Rewards**: 95% of wagered value returned to winners
- **Transparent Costs**: Exact 5% fee, no surprises
- **Instant Redemption**: Loot converts directly to Lightning sats
- **Skill-Based Rewards**: Merit-based competitive system

### For System
- **Sustainable Operations**: 5% covers infrastructure costs
- **Growth Funding**: Minimal fee enables platform development
- **Anti-Cheat Funding**: Covers cryptographic validation costs
- **Decentralized Viability**: Self-sustaining without external funding

## Testing Validation

### Automated Test Results ✅

```
🎯 OPTIMIZED ECONOMICS TEST RESULTS:
✅ 100 mana wagered → 95 loot tokens (95% efficiency)
✅ Economic breakdown: 95 loot to winner, 5 mana fee to system  
✅ Mathematical validation: 95 + 5 = 100 (perfect split)
✅ Integration test: Winner claimed 95 loot from 100 total wagered
```

### Edge Case Handling

#### **Minimum Wager Requirements**
- **Army Constraint**: Every match requires at least 2 mana total (1 per player for army generation)
- **Invalid Wagers**: < 2 mana total will panic - no armies can be created
- **Player Protection**: System validates wager minimums before calculation

#### **Small Wager Examples**
```rust
// Minimum valid wager
let distribution_2 = calculate_loot_distribution(2);
assert_eq!(distribution_2.player_loot_amount, 1); // 2 * 95/100 = 1
assert_eq!(distribution_2.system_fee, 1);

// Slightly higher wager
let distribution_3 = calculate_loot_distribution(3);
assert_eq!(distribution_3.player_loot_amount, 2); // 3 * 95/100 = 2  
assert_eq!(distribution_3.system_fee, 1);

// Invalid wagers (will panic)
calculate_loot_distribution(0); // ❌ No armies possible
calculate_loot_distribution(1); // ❌ Only one army possible
```

#### **Integer Division Handling**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_odd_number_handling() {
    let distribution = calculate_loot_distribution(101);
    // 101 * 95 / 100 = 95 (integer division)
    assert_eq!(distribution.player_loot_amount, 95);
    assert_eq!(distribution.system_fee, 6); // Remainder to system
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Draw Scenarios (Planned)
```rust
// Each player gets back 95% of their own wager
pub fn calculate_draw_scenario(player1_wager: u64, player2_wager: u64) -> DrawLootDistribution {
    let player1_refund = (player1_wager * 95) / 100;
    let player2_refund = (player2_wager * 95) / 100;
    // System keeps 5% from each player
}
```

### Tournament Support (Planned)
- **Multi-player pools**: 95% distributed among top performers  
- **Progressive rewards**: Different percentages for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place
- **Entry fee handling**: Consistent 5% system fee across formats

## Implementation Guide

For developers building on this economic model:

### 1. **Always Use the Economic Model Module**
```rust
use crate::economic_model::EconomicModel;

let distribution = EconomicModel::calculate_loot_distribution(total_wager);
```

### 2. **Validate All Calculations**
```rust
assert!(EconomicModel::validate_distribution(&distribution));
```

### 3. **Log Economic Transparency**
```rust
info!("💰 OPTIMIZED ECONOMICS: {} mana → {} loot (95% efficiency)", 
      distribution.total_mana_wagered, distribution.player_loot_amount);
```

### 4. **Document All Economic Decisions**
- Always explain the 95/5 split in user-facing code
- Include economic rationale in commit messages
- Maintain backwards compatibility for economic calculations

### 5. **Handle Edge Cases Properly**
```rust
// ✅ CORRECT: Validate minimum wager requirements
if total_wager < 2 {
    return Err("Matches require at least 2 mana total for armies");
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Use the economic model for all calculations
let distribution = EconomicModel::calculate_loot_distribution(total_wager);
assert!(EconomicModel::validate_distribution(&distribution));
```

### 6. **Army Generation Constraint**
- **Never allow matches with < 2 mana total** 
- Each player needs ≥ 1 mana token to generate an army
- System enforces this constraint via panic for invalid wagers
- UI should prevent users from creating invalid wagers
