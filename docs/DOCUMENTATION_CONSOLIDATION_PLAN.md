# 📚 Documentation Consolidation Plan
## Streamlined Protocol & Game Development Guide

This document outlines a plan to consolidate the extensive documentation into a focused set that clearly explains:
1. **How the revolutionary zero-coordination gaming protocol works**
2. **How developers can leverage this codebase to build their own games**

## 🎯 Target Documentation Structure

- Parts of `architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` (high-level flow)

**Content:**
- Revolutionary zero-coordination gaming principles
- Complete Nostr event specification
- Token economics and army generation
- Game engine validation role
- Anti-cheat mechanisms

#### 2. Create `GETTING_STARTED.md` (New Developer Guide)
**Merge from:**
- `specifications/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`
- `specifications/NOSTR_RELAY_SETUP.md`
- Parts of existing setup documentation

**Content:**
- Prerequisites and installation
- Running the integration tests
- Understanding the example game
- Basic customization points

#### 3. Create `BUILDING_YOUR_GAME.md` (New Game Developer Guide)
**Merge from:**
- `specifications/WEB_CLIENT_SPEC.md` (client patterns)
- `specifications/WASM_SHARED_LOGIC_SPEC.md` (shared logic concepts)
- `specifications/RUST_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (implementation patterns)

**Content:**
- Protocol compliance requirements
- Customizing game rules and combat
- Implementing client applications
- Deploying your own infrastructure
- Security considerations

#### 4. Create `reference/` folder (Technical Reference)
**Consolidate from:**
- Detailed API specifications
- Complete Nostr event schemas
- Deployment configurations
- Advanced customization options

### Documents to Remove/Archive

#### Team & Planning Documents (Archive)
- `team/` - Move to `archive/team/`
- `agent-memory/` - Move to `archive/agent-memory/`
- `planning/` (already in root) - Keep for project context

#### Outdated Specifications (Remove)
- `specifications/SIMPLIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Superseded by consolidated docs
- `architecture/COMPONENT_BREAKDOWN.md` - Merge relevant parts into protocol spec
- Duplicate or obsolete technical specifications

2. **Update main `docs/README.md`**
   - Create clear navigation to consolidated docs
   - Reference diagram documentation
   - Provide quick links for different user types

### Phase 2: Reference Materials
1. **Create `reference/` folder**
   - Extract detailed API specifications
   - Consolidate Nostr event schemas
   - Create deployment reference guide

2. **Cross-reference integration**
   - Link between consolidated docs and references
   - Ensure diagram documentation is properly referenced
   - Update all internal links

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. **Archive outdated documentation**
   - Move team/planning docs to `archive/`
   - Remove duplicate or obsolete specifications
   - Clean up broken links

2. **Validation**
   - Verify all consolidated information is accurate
   - Test that getting started guide actually works
   - Ensure building your game guide is complete
