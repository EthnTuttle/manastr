# 🎮 Mana Strategy Game Protocol Documentation
## Revolutionary Zero-Coordination Gaming

Welcome to the documentation for the **world's first zero-coordination multiplayer gaming protocol**. This codebase demonstrates a fundamental breakthrough in multiplayer game design that eliminates the need for trusted game servers while ensuring perfect fairness.

## 🚀 What Makes This Revolutionary?

### Zero-Coordination Gaming
- **👥 Players Control Everything**: Complete match flow driven by player actions via Nostr events
- **🎮 Game Engine Cannot Cheat**: Acts as pure validator, cannot manipulate outcomes or coordinate matches
- **🔐 Perfect Anti-Cheat**: Cryptographic commitment/reveal scheme prevents all forms of cheating
- **💰 Economic Alignment**: Real mana token stakes create proper skin-in-the-game dynamics
- **🌐 Complete Decentralization**: No trusted servers or central coordination required

### Technical Innovations
- **📡 Nostr-First Communication**: All player interactions via decentralized Nostr events
- **🪙 Cashu Token Integration**: Cryptographic C values provide tamper-proof army randomness
- **⚔️ Shared Combat Logic**: Identical deterministic outcomes across all participants
- **🔥 Exclusive Authority**: Only game engine can burn mana tokens after validation
- **🏗️ Rust-First Architecture**: Production-ready cross-platform implementation

## 🎮 Quick Start

Want to see the revolutionary gaming protocol in action?

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/manastr.git
cd manastr/daemons

# Run the complete integration test
cargo run --bin integration-runner

# Watch the magic happen:
# ✅ Services start automatically
# ✅ Players create armies from Cashu token randomness  
# ✅ Complete match plays out via Nostr events
# ✅ Game engine validates and distributes loot
# ✅ Zero coordination required!
```

## 🌟 Revolutionary Protocol Features

### 8-Phase Player-Driven Match Lifecycle
1. **👥 Player Creation**: Generate armies from Cashu token C values
2. **⚔️ Match Challenge**: Player publishes challenge via Nostr (KIND 31000)
3. **🤝 Match Acceptance**: Opponent accepts via Nostr (KIND 31001)  
4. **🔓 Token Revelation**: Players reveal tokens for verification (KIND 31002)
5. **⚔️ Combat Rounds**: Commitment/reveal combat via Nostr (KIND 31003/31004)
6. **📊 Match Results**: Players submit outcomes via Nostr (KIND 31005)
7. **🏆 Game Engine Validation**: Engine validates and distributes loot (KIND 31006)
8. **✅ Final Verification**: Complete event chain verified on relay

### Perfect Anti-Cheat System
- **Cryptographic Commitments**: Players commit to actions before revealing
- **Token Authenticity**: All mana tokens verified with Cashu mint
- **Double-Spend Prevention**: Game engine prevents token reuse across matches
- **Deterministic Armies**: Army generation from mint C values cannot be manipulated
- **Shared Logic**: Combat resolution identical across all participants

### Complete Economic Cycle
```
Lightning Sats → Mana Tokens → Army Generation → Combat → Loot Tokens → Lightning Sats
```
