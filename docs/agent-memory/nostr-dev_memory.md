# nostr-dev - Agent Memory

## Current Assignment
- **Task ID:** F3
- **Task Name:** Nostr relay setup and event flow specification
- **Started:** 2024-01-27
- **Last Active:** 2024-01-27
- **Status:** In Progress

## Task Context
- **Dependencies Required:** None (foundation task)
- **Dependencies Met:** ✅ strfry chosen as relay, event schemas from spec.md
- **Blocks These Tasks:** D2 (Nostr Relay implementation)
- **Human Decisions Needed:** None

## Progress Journal
```
2024-01-27 - Started F3 specification. Working with strfry relay and game event schemas.
2024-01-27 - Researched strfry setup, build process, and configuration options.
2024-01-27 - Completed comprehensive Nostr relay setup and event flow specification.
```

## Current State
- **Files Created:** `/docs/specifications/NOSTR_RELAY_SETUP.md`
- **Code/Documentation Written:** Complete relay setup and event specification
- **Architectural Decisions Made:**
  - Use strfry with LMDB storage for all game data persistence
  - 8 distinct event types for complete match lifecycle
  - Bot authority events (match announcement, results, rewards)
  - 24-hour event retention for match completion
  - Game-specific validation rules and rate limiting
- **Research Completed:** Strfry architecture, build process, configuration, event schemas

## Immediate Next Steps
✅ 1. Research strfry setup and configuration - COMPLETE
✅ 2. Define game-specific event schemas - COMPLETE (8 event types)
✅ 3. Specify relay configuration for local development - COMPLETE
✅ 4. Document event flow and validation - COMPLETE
✅ 5. Define integration with game engine bot - COMPLETE

**F3 TASK COMPLETE - Ready for D2 implementation**

## Blockers & Dependencies
- **Currently Blocked By:** None
- **Waiting For:** None
- **Can Proceed When:** Task complete

## Handoff Information
- **For Next Agent:** Complete relay specification in `/docs/specifications/NOSTR_RELAY_SETUP.md`
- **Interface Contracts:**
  - 8 event types with complete JSON schemas (challenge, commitment, reveal, results)
  - Bot subscription filters and publishing patterns
  - Event validation rules (client and relay-side)
  - WebSocket integration at ws://localhost:7777
  - Query patterns for match history and leaderboard data
- **Assumptions Made:** Strfry stores all game data (no separate database), bot has authority for results

## Quality Checklist
✅ Strfry setup documented (build, config, startup scripts)
✅ Event schemas clearly defined (8 types with complete JSON examples)
✅ Relay configuration specified (local development optimized)
✅ Event validation rules documented (signature, format, game-specific)
✅ Integration with bot specified (filters, publishing, authority patterns)
