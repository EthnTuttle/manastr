# game-engine - Agent Memory

## Current Assignment
- **Task ID:** F2
- **Task Name:** Game engine bot logic specification
- **Started:** 2024-01-27
- **Last Active:** 2024-01-27
- **Status:** In Progress

## Task Context
- **Dependencies Required:** None (foundation task)
- **Dependencies Met:** ✅ Token economics defined, game mechanics from spec.md
- **Blocks These Tasks:** D3 (Game Engine Bot implementation)
- **Human Decisions Needed:** None

## Progress Journal
```
2024-01-27 - Started F2 specification. Building on existing game mechanics from spec.md.
2024-01-27 - Analyzed spec.md combat rules and match structure.
2024-01-27 - Completed comprehensive game engine bot specification.
```

## Current State
- **Files Created:** `/docs/specifications/GAME_ENGINE_BOT_SPEC.md`
- **Code/Documentation Written:** Complete bot architecture specification
- **Architectural Decisions Made:**
  - Bot has authority to create loot tokens and publish authoritative results
  - Event-driven architecture processing Nostr events
  - Match state machine with proper phase transitions
  - Combat resolution following spec.md rules exactly
  - Integration with Cashu mint for token verification and loot creation
- **Research Completed:** Spec.md game mechanics, combat rules, match structure

## Immediate Next Steps
✅ 1. Define bot authority and responsibilities - COMPLETE
✅ 2. Specify Nostr event processing logic - COMPLETE
✅ 3. Detail combat resolution algorithms - COMPLETE
✅ 4. Define match state machine transitions - COMPLETE
✅ 5. Specify integration with Cashu mint for loot creation - COMPLETE

**F2 TASK COMPLETE - Ready for D3 implementation**

## Blockers & Dependencies
- **Currently Blocked By:** None
- **Waiting For:** None
- **Can Proceed When:** Task complete

## Handoff Information
- **For Next Agent:** Complete bot specification in `/docs/specifications/GAME_ENGINE_BOT_SPEC.md`
- **Interface Contracts:**
  - Event processing functions for challenge/commitment/reveal
  - Combat resolution engine with exact damage calculations
  - Match state management with proper phase transitions
  - Cashu mint API integration (verify tokens, create loot)
  - Nostr event publishing for results and rewards
- **Assumptions Made:** Bot runs at :4444, has authority over loot creation, publishes authoritative results

## Quality Checklist
✅ Bot responsibilities clearly defined (authoritative match resolution)
✅ Event processing logic specified (classify, validate, process)
✅ Combat algorithms documented (exact damage calc, abilities, healing)
✅ State machine transitions mapped (6 phases with proper flow)
✅ Integration points with other services defined (Cashu, Nostr, web client)
