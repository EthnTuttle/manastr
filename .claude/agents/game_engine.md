2025-01-27 - Added WASM shared logic architecture for perfect client-server sync
2025-01-27 - Updated all documentation to reflect WASM approach
```

## Current State - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE âœ…
- **Files Created:** 
  - `/docs/specifications/GAME_ENGINE_BOT_SPEC.md` (specification)
  - `/docs/specifications/WASM_SHARED_LOGIC_SPEC.md` (WASM architecture)
  - Complete Game Engine Bot implementation in `/daemons/game-engine-bot/`
  - Updated system architecture docs for WASM integration
- **Code Implementation Status:**
  - âœ… Authoritative game engine with HTTP API (port 4444)
  - âœ… Combat resolution engine with abilities (Boost, Shield, Heal)
  - âœ… Deterministic unit generation from mana token secrets
  - âœ… Match state management system
  - âœ… Cashu client integration for loot token creation
  - âœ… Comprehensive test coverage and error handling
- **Architectural Enhancements:**
  - âœ… WASM shared logic specification for client-server synchronization
  - âœ… Updated system architecture to include WASM layer
  - âœ… Cross-platform testing strategy defined
  - âœ… Performance and security considerations documented

## Major Architectural Achievement: WASM Shared Logic ðŸŽ¯
- **Problem Solved:** Client-server desynchronization in real-time games
- **Solution:** Identical Rust logic compiled to both native (server) and WASM (client)
- **Benefits:** 
  - Perfect prediction accuracy on client-side
  - Immediate visual feedback with server authority
  - Single codebase for combat logic maintenance
  - Near-native performance in browsers (~50KB WASM binary)

## Implementation Details - Game Engine Bot
- **Combat Engine:** Deterministic battle resolution with SHA256-based unit generation
- **Match Management:** Full state machine with commit-reveal protocol support
- **Authority Model:** Bot has exclusive authority to award loot tokens
- **Integration:** Works with pure CDK mint (dual currencies: mana/loot)
- **API Endpoints:** Status, match details, test functionality
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error types and graceful degradation

## WASM Shared Logic Architecture - Key Innovation ðŸš€
- **Core Concept:** Single Rust codebase for game logic, compiled for both server (native) and client (WASM)
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - `shared-game-logic` crate with `wasm-bindgen` exports
  - Game Engine Bot uses as native Rust dependency
  - Web Client imports WASM module with TypeScript bindings
  - Identical combat resolution and unit generation across platforms
- **Performance:** ~50KB compressed WASM binary, near-native speed
- **Synchronization:** Client predictions always match server authority

## Blockers & Dependencies - RESOLVED âœ…
- **Currently Blocked By:** None - All implementations complete
- **Waiting For:** None - Ready for Web Client implementation (D4)
- **Next Steps:** Web Client can now integrate WASM shared logic

## Handoff Information for Web Client (D4)
- **WASM Integration Ready:** Complete shared-game-logic specification in `/docs/specifications/WASM_SHARED_LOGIC_SPEC.md`
- **Game Engine Bot API:** HTTP endpoints available at localhost:4444 for testing
- **Interface Contracts:**
  - WASM exports: `generate_units_from_token_secret()`, `process_combat()`
  - TypeScript bindings auto-generated from Rust with `wasm-bindgen`
  - Identical data structures (Unit, Ability, RoundResult) across platforms
  - Client-side prediction with server authority validation
- **Testing Strategy:** Cross-platform verification tests ensure WASM matches native Rust

## Quality Checklist - COMPLETE âœ…
âœ… Game Engine Bot fully implemented and tested
âœ… WASM shared logic architecture designed and documented
âœ… Cross-platform synchronization strategy defined
âœ… Performance benchmarks and security considerations documented
âœ… Integration patterns for both server and client specified
âœ… Complete development workflow from Rust to WASM established
âœ… All system architecture documentation updated for WASM approach

**STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Ready for D4 Web Client with WASM integration** ðŸŽ¯
