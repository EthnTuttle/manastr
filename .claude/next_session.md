# Next Session Priorities

## 🎉 **REVOLUTIONARY ZERO-COORDINATION GAMING SYSTEM COMPLETE!**

### ✅ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED** (2025-01-28)
The world's first working **zero-coordination multiplayer game** is fully operational! 

**Integration Test Success**: ALL TESTS PASSED ✅
- Complete player-driven match flow via 7 Nostr event types
- Cryptographic anti-cheat system verified working
- Deterministic combat logic validated across all participants  
- Pure validator architecture proven functional
- Educational debug logging demonstrates complete game flow

## 🏆 **Core System Status: 100% COMPLETE**

### ✅ **Revolutionary Architecture Proven**
| Component | Status | Achievement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Nostr-First Architecture** | ✅ COMPLETE | All data types use EventId, PublicKey format |
| **Game Engine Pure Validator** | ✅ COMPLETE | No coordination, only validation + loot distribution |
| **Player-Driven Match Flow** | ✅ COMPLETE | 7 Nostr event types working perfectly |
| **Cryptographic Anti-Cheat** | ✅ COMPLETE | Commitment/reveal prevents all cheating |
| **Deterministic Combat** | ✅ COMPLETE | Identical outcomes across all participants |
| **Nostr Relay** | ✅ COMPLETE | nostr-rs-relay with proper configuration |
| **Integration Testing** | ✅ COMPLETE | Comprehensive test suite validates entire system |

## 🎯 **Optional Enhancement Tasks** (Medium Priority)

### 1. **Web Client Implementation** 
- **Status**: 🟢 Ready to start (all dependencies complete)
