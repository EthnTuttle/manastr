## Human Decision Requirements

### H1: Cashu Library Selection (CRITICAL - BLOCKS C1)
**Decision Needed:** Which Rust Cashu implementation to use
**Options to Research:**
- `cashu` crate (if available)
- Custom implementation using `secp256k1` + `sha2`
- Fork existing implementation

**Impact:** Blocks all token-related implementation
**Agent Prep Work:** crypto-specialist can research available options

### H2: Reward Pool Economics  
**Decision Needed:** Loot token amounts and distribution percentages
**Questions:**
- How much loot for match wins? (currently: 1000 loot)
- Seasonal reward pool size?
- Top player percentage (top 10%? top 5%?)
- Minimum games to qualify for rewards?

**Agent Prep Work:** leaderboard-dev can model different scenarios

### H3: UI/UX Design Approval
**Decision Needed:** Approve component designs and user flows
**Process:**
1. ui-dev creates mockups based on game mechanics
2. Human reviews and provides feedback
3. ui-dev revises based on feedback
4. Human gives final approval

### H4: Game Balance Review
**Decision Needed:** Validate unit stat ranges and league modifiers
**Process:**
1. game-engine creates balance model with statistics
2. Human reviews for fairness and fun factor
3. Adjustments made if needed

### H5: Tournament Period Length
**Decision Needed:** How often to distribute seasonal rewards
**Options:** Daily, weekly, monthly, custom periods
**Impact:** Affects player engagement and loot token economics

## Agent Assignment Strategy

### Phase 1A: Foundation Research (Start Immediately)
- **crypto-specialist** â†’ F1 (NUT Analysis) + H1 research (Cashu options)
- **game-engine** â†’ F2 (Game Mechanics) + balance modeling for H4
- **nostr-dev** â†’ F3 (Nostr Events)
- **architect** â†’ F4 (Database) + F5 (API Design)
- **leaderboard-dev** â†’ Economic modeling for H2

### Phase 1B: Human Review Cycle
- **Human** â†’ Review H1, H2, H4, H5 decisions
- **ui-dev** â†’ H-F6 (UI Specs) after F5 complete
- **crypto-specialist** â†’ H-F7 (Security Review) after F1 complete

### Phase 1C: Approved Specifications
Only after human approvals can implementation begin.

## Critical Path Analysis

### Human Decision Bottlenecks:
1. **H1 (Cashu Library)** â†’ Blocks C1 â†’ Blocks C6, C7, E2
2. **H3 (UI Approval)** â†’ Blocks C8 â†’ Blocks T2, T3
3. **H2 (Economics)** â†’ Blocks E2 (Enhanced Rewards)

### Fastest Path to Implementation:
1. Agents complete all foundation tasks (F1-F5)
2. Human makes critical decisions (H1, H2, H3)
3. Implementation tasks become unblocked

## Task Readiness Indicators

### ðŸŸ¢ Ready for Human Review:
- [ ] F1 Complete â†’ H-F7 ready for security review
- [ ] F2 Complete â†’ H-F8 ready for balance review  
- [ ] F5 Complete â†’ H-F6 ready for UI review

### ðŸŸ¢ Ready for Agent Work:
- [ ] H1 Decided â†’ C1 (Cashu Mint) ready
- [ ] H2 Decided â†’ C6 (Leaderboard) ready
- [ ] H3 Approved â†’ C8 (Frontend) ready

### ðŸŸ¡ Waiting State:
All implementation tasks wait for human decisions and specification approvals.

## Human Interaction Schedule

### Recommended Review Cycles:
1. **Foundation Review** (After F1-F5 complete): Review all specifications
2. **Implementation Kickoff** (After human decisions): Approve start of coding
3. **Mid-Development Review**: Check progress and adjust if needed
4. **Pre-Testing Review**: Validate completed features
5. **Deployment Approval**: Final go-live decision

This board shows that human decisions are critical gatekeepers for implementation phases, but agents can prepare extensively beforehand!
